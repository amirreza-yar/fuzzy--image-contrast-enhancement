# Fuzzy Image Contrast Enhancement

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tools and scripts for enhancing image contrast using fuzzy logic. The project utilizes Python libraries such as `numpy`, `opencv-python`, and `matplotlib` to perform tasks like contrast enhancement, visualization, and analysis of images. This repository is inspired by a Kaggle notebook and aims to provide a robust method for improving the visual quality of images.

## Key Features

- **Image Loading and Saving**: Efficiently read and write image files using `opencv-python`.
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Apply fuzzy logic-based methods to enhance image contrast.
- **Visualization**: Generate and visualize original and enhanced images.
- **Adaptive Processing**: Adapt to different image types and qualities for optimal enhancement.

See the [Document]() for more details.

## Installation

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```
To use the jupyter notebook file, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `notebook`
- `IPython`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install notebook IPython
```
## Usage

After installing the required packages, you can use the scripts provided to enhance the contrast of your images. Here's an example of how to use the main script:

## Example

Here is an example of the project in action. This section should include images showing the original and enhanced versions for a clear demonstration of the project's capabilities.
